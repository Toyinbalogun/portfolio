        I design and develop solutions using programming languages and
            frameworks like Java, Python, C++, React, etc. to solve problems and
            make services easier. When I am not programming or problem-solving,
            I spend my time playing video games and discovering new science
            fiction books/movies, camping and enjoying food. Welcome to my
            porfolio and have fun browsing through ðŸ˜Š!
